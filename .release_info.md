## Changes
* Logging was revamped to use the terraform logging library across the board, so the level configured there will be the level used as the provider does it's work. The existing `debug` parameter on the provider and objects will now only affect whether or not the client spits out the HTTP request and response to STDOUT as it work. This is separate and independent from the Terraform log stream and log level.
* Moved to the latest v2 of the TFSDK for providers. This should eliminate warnings (#337) while also not affecting behaviors
* The default timeout for the HTTP client has been set to 30 seconds instead of "infinite"
* The provider now validates the URI provided is a parseable URI

## Fixes
* Fixed some cases where some fields were not logged and clarify the request/response body in HTTP output. Thanks for the PR in #316, @rforen!

## New
* In addition to username/password, added a new `bearer_token` parameter to the provider in #301 - thanks, @Dr-J-Watson!

## Misc
* Obtain a clean HTTP client from terraform rather than the Go runtime. This avoids other providers possibly polluting the default client from affecting us.
* Along with revamping logging, the file name from which the log entry came is no longer logged.

## TODO
* Add tests for OAuth
* Extract logic for read_search in object and abstract it for resource and datasource use
