## New
- @michaelPotter added an **awesome** new feature to detect/repair remote changes in #216 aligned with Terraform's test/repair paradigm! See `ignore_changes_to` and `ignore_all_server_changes`!
- You can set which CAs you trust in the provider directly instead of using only the system-managed certs thanks to #270 by @daniel-butler-irl!
- Thanks to @Wiston999 in #266, you can pass `search_data` as a body to performing searches!

## Fixed
- Fix a case where missing resources don't get recreated by Terraform. Thanks, @mauriceackel for #282!
- You can search for boolean values now. Thanks for the bug report in #227, Mykhailo-Roit!

## Misc
- Thanks for the shell of SECURITY.md in #261, @ScorpiusDraconis83
- Updated LICENSE file to match full APLv2 text so GitHub API reports the correct license. Thanks for the heads up in #238, @EhrichPeter!
- Avoid logging potentially sensitive data unless debug mode is enabled. Thanks for the report in #276, @karand1979
