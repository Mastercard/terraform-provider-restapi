## Fixed
- Thanks to a proposal in #202 by @harshavmb, the long broken `endpoint_params` in `oauth_client_credentials` is working!
- Fix incorrect state after failed updates when errors are detected. Thanks for the report #152, @jollyroger and the PR #265, @ugur-zongur!

## Misc
- Bring goreleaser config up to version 2
