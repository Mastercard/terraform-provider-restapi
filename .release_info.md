## New
- Allow for empty responses to be treated as `{}` for APIs that give no answer on create. Thanks for the tweak in #226, alahijani!
- Add support for sending a body (`read_data`) during read operations for APIs that are a little less REST-y. Thanks for the feature in #252, @detvdl!

## Misc
- Bump some dependnecies to keep them current
