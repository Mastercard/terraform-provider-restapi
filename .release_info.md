## Changes
* Logging was revamped to use the terraform logging library. The debug parameter will now only affect whether or not the client spits out the HTTP request and response.

## Misc
* Obtain a clean HTTP client from terraform rather than the Go runtime. This avoids other providers possibly polluting the default client from affecting us.
* Along with revamping logging, the file name from which the log entry came is no longer logged.
